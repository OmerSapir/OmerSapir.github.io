* Hello! I'm Omer Sapir, a master's student at the Weizmann Institute, in the Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences.

* Currently on a rotation at [Prof. Yinon Rudich lab](https://www.weizmann.ac.il/EPS/Rudich/home).
  Our lab is studying the properties of different types of aerosols and how they affect atmospheric processes, climate, and human health.

* I'm mainly interested in Plants, Atmosphere, and the interactions between them.

* Loves to climb and travel!
  Here's me in Kashmir, India:
